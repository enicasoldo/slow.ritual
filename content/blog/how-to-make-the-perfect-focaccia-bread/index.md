Focaccia is a typical and 'poor' dish from Southern Italy. There are plenty of variantions and fillings for this 'bread': you can have it with potatoes, onions, olives and many other toppings strongly related to the local produce. Below, the recipe to make the most basic, popular and delious focaccia from its native place: Apulia Region (the 'heel' of Italy).

For many ways, making focaccia is like making bread: it involves manual work to knead the dough, patience to wait for it to leaven properly and resilience: it may not come perfect from the oven at the first try! But I promise, the day it will, it will be worth the effort. Because there's nothing more satisfying than choosing first-class ingredients for your food and cook it yourself for you and your loved ones.

Enjoy the journey to make the tastiest focaccia!

_Ingredients_

- 500g strong bread flour , plus extra for dusting
- 7g dried fast action yeast
- 2 tsp fine sea salt
- 5 tbsp olive oil , plus extra for the tin and to serve
- 1 tsp flaky sea salt
- ¼ small bunch of rosemary , sprigs picked
- 300g cherry tomatoes

_Directions_

- STEP 1 Tip the flour into a large mixing bowl or on a clean surface. Mix the yeast into one side of the flour, and the fine salt into the other side. Then mix everything together, this initial seperation prevents the salt from killing the yeast.
- STEP 2 Make a well in the middle of the flour and add 2 tbsp oil and 350-400ml lukewarm water, adding it gradually until you have a slightly sticky dough (you may not need all the water). Sprinkle the work surface with flour and tip the dough onto it, scraping around the sides of the bowl. Knead for 5-10 mins until your dough is soft and less sticky. Put the dough into a clean bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to prove for 1 hr until doubled in size.
- STEP 3 Oil a rectangle, shallow tin (25 x 35cm). Tip the dough onto the work surface, then stretch it to fill the tin. Cover with a tea towel and leave to prove for another 35-45 mins.
- STEP 4 Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Press your fingers into the dough to make dimples. Mix together 1½ tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp water and the flaky salt and drizzle over the bread. Push sprigs of rosemary and cherry tomatoes cut into halves into the dimples in the dough.
- STEP 5 Bake for 20 mins until golden. Cut into squares and serve warm or cold.

FOOD FACT: in Bari, the home of focaccia, people serve it by cut into squares or triangles with a slice of Mortadella on top.
