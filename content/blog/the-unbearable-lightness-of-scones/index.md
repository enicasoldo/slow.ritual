I've never eaten a scone until I moved to Ireland around three years ago. It was love at the first bite and soon I wanted to learn how to make them at home. Tried so many recipes before getting to the perfect one, at least for my tastes!

These **buttermilk** scones are definitely my ideal of scones: tasty, as much heavy as light, perfect for both savoury and sweet fillings. But you know what? This recipe is so good that most of the times I eat them freshly baked out of the oven, still warm and soft.

_Ingredients_

450g self-rising **flour**
pinch of salt
100g **butter**
85g **caster sugar**
300ml **buttermilk**
whole milk for brushing

_Method_

1. Preheat the oven at 220ÂºC. Dust a baking sheet with flour.

2. Put flour and salt into a bowl. Add the butter and rub it in with your fingertips until fine crumbs form. Add the sugar and mix to combine.

3. Heat the buttermilk over a low heat until lukewarm. Gradually add the flour mixture, cutting it in with a knife until just combined.

4. Turn out the dough onto a work surface lightly dusted with flour and bring it together with your hands. Press it out to thickness of 3-4 cm, then use a 6cm round biscuit/scone cutter to cut out 12 scones, reshaping the trimmings as necessary.

5. Place the scones on the prepared baking sheet then brush with a little milk and bake for 10-12 minutes. Remove from the oven and transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool slightly. Serve warm.
