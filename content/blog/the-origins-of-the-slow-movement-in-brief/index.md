The slow movement began with the creation of the slow food movement in 1986, after an Italian man named Carlo Petrini protested against the approval of a fast-food restaurant in the Piazza di Spagna, in the heart of Rome.

The slow food movements promotes the principles of organic, non-processed foods where the chain from farm to table has a minimal impact on the environment.

The concept of 'slow' has since filtered down into other parts of modern society, such as slow parenting and slow cities, culminating in the formation of Norway-based World Insitute of Slowness in 1999 by Geir Berthelsen, which aims to tech the world the ways of slow living.

Another notable advocate of slow licing is Carl Honor√®, who, in 2004 book, In Praise of slow, explored how slow living could be maintained, particularly in a business environment.
