It seems today that we have reached the stage of turning every moment into some sort of race. We rush to work, we rush to make dinner, we rush to get the children and the house organised, we rush our correspondence and social interactions.

Where will it end? It is no wonder that many of us are made breathless by our every day lives and want to somehow step off the treadmill.

Slow living is just that: a chance to stop the idea that being busy is the be-all and end-all, to start paying attention to the important things in life, and to slow down to a pace that is right for you. We strongly believe that slow living is a stepping stone to happiness and good health, because when we live to a slower paace, we are more in the moment and able to immerse ourselves in what we are doing and take the full pleasure from it. Taking the slow lane means fewer mistakes are made and it offers us the opportunity to be more considered in our actions.

In terms of health, slowing down calms our breathing and reduces stress. There is the added benefit of building stronger relantionshipswith friends and loved ones by tking the time to connect with each other.

Slower is not about low efficiency or giving up your job, or being idle. It is about creating balance and cllocating pocj=kets of time to reflect, to think, yto plan, to observe and to give focus to what really matters - to do things better then instead of faster and in turn to become more productive.

How different would your life be if you werent whirling from one thing to th next, trying to keep the plates soinning in the air?

Slow gives you the tools to do just that: se set out ways to streamline your life and make it simpleer, more efficient, nd more productve by doing things at th right speed.

The rest is up to you.
