There are many ways to slow down- it's all about discovering a slow ritual that works for you.

Below I will list a few of them that I particularly benefit from and included in my daily routine.

_**Mindfulness - Being in the moment**_

Maintaining a mindful attitude is a very positive way of slowing down time. Mindfulness is about focusing on the magic of the presen moment. Rather than fretting about the past or worrying about the future, the aim is to experience life as it unfolds, moment by moment.

This simple practise is immensely powerful and an effective tool for slowing down to a more comfortable pace. As we rush through our lives, mindfulness encourages us to stio constantly striving for something new or better to embrace acceptance and gratitude. Many of us rush through outr daily routines and autopilot, barely noticing what we are doing.

An easy way to focus your attention on the present moment is to concentrate on simple tasks. For instance, make your bed with 100% focus and attention each morning so you create a calm transition from bedroom and sleep to the outside world and the rest of your day. You might also find it useful to sit quietly for a few minutes in the morning so that you can calmly contemplate the day ahead (this last one is my favourite), instead of rushing straight into your day's activities, or to embrace your time in the shower, taking a moemnt to think about the running water washing away sleep, energising you for the rest of the day.

_**Breathing exercises**_

Slow, deep breathing re-oxygenates the body, which slows our hearthbeat and stabilises blood pressure. Try this exercise for instant calm. This can be done at anytime of the day, whether before bed, first thing in the morning or at your desk at home or in the office.

The practise is simple: close your eyes and focus on your breath. Think only about your breath and the ways it feels coming into your body and then out. Once you are fully aware of your breathing , try taking deeper breaths , breathing in for a count of six and then out for a count of six. Stay focused on your breath for five minutes. Integrating this exercise into your daily routine will help you on your way too feeling more relaxed whenever you are.

_**Do less, notice more**_

Instead of cramming as much as possible into your day, do less and do it more slowly, more fully and with more concentration.

Take time to immerse yourself fully in whatever activity you are doing , whether you're cooking supper or chatting to a friend, even for the less fun activities like cleaning the dishes. You should find your experiences relaxing and fulfilling when you're not rushing through them.

_**Stay grounded**_

The next time you find yourself rushing, it could be when you're on an errand or whizzing round the supermarket to get the evening meal, focus your awareness on your feet.

Try to slow down your pace and feel your feet connecting you with the ground. How does it feel? Warm, cold, hard, uneven or even soft? Thinking about something as simple as the ground beneath your feet will help ypu to gain a sense of balance and perspective, and most importantly, slow you down.
