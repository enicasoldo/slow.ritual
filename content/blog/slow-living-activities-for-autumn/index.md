Another year passed (and what a year it has been so far!), another summer is gone, and another welcome to autumn.

**“Delicious autumn! My very soul is wedded to it, and if I were a bird I would fly about the earth seeking the successive autumns.” - George Eliot**

I truly do love this time of year. I think it’s really the most coziness you can get. Together time. It’s very hyggelig and that’s why I love it so much. Things slow down, the pace changes, we get into habits and routines and just be. And as someone who lives slowly, this is the perfect time for me. I’d trade a summer by the beach any day for an autumn wrapped up in blankets by the fireplace with my friends chatting away and drinking tea. It’s definitely my kind of thing. I’ve put together a list of some of my favorite things to do for autumn when you’re slow living. And maybe, if you’re used to go, go, go, this year you’ll slow down a bit, embrace the rhythms of fall, and see how it might just change your life.

**_Bake, bake, bake_**

This one is definitely first on my list. Truly, what says “autumn” more than a kitchen filled with fresh baked goods? Tis’ the season for giving, and my favorite way to show someone I care is by bringing them a treat. I usually spend hours in the kitchen around this time trying new recipes and snacking in between. It’s such a special time, and I love seeing the joy on people’s faces when they come into our home and have something warm to enjoy. Here are some of my favorite baked goods recipes.

[This focaccia recipe is divine.]()

These [buttermilk scones]() are little drops of even, plus they're easy and quick to make.

I basically worship the Italian food recipes site [Giallo Zafferano](), there's no cooking tip they offer that hasn't work smoothly in my kitchen so far. And this [Tiramisù]() is as much simple and classic as delicous.

If you’ve got time and patience to wait for your cooking efforts to 'prove', I’ve always wanted to make this [homamade sourdough starter]() from BBC - Good Food. They always publish delectable recipes and their monthly paper magazines are as beautiful as the food. Even if you’re not up for baking your own bread, you'll find their tips and kitchen advice very helpful.

Other great sources of inspiration for recipes and not only are the printed version of Country Living Mag, and the Olive Magazine website - actually got from the last one my favorite [cookie recipe]() ever. Soo delicious!

_**Forage for berries**_

Berries are abundant during this time of year. While I’m in Ireland, I’ve been going on morning runs and have seen so many blackberries lining the roads and trails. One great idea is to take a basket outside and wander to your nearest forest (you want to be away from the roads so you don’t get any berries with smog on them) to forage for berries. Fill up your basket and then bring them home, place them in a bowl and fill with water in the sink to make sure all the dirt and little friends pop up to the top, then clean them off and they’re ready to eat or bake with.

_**Craft and DIY**_

I love getting crafty in the cooler months. Making wreaths, decorating the house, candle-making and knitting. It’s all my favorite. A few crafts and DIY’s I love:

We are knitters offers a great platform with blogs, video tutorials, patterns and ideas to get it started: you'll find there kits to create your [very first knitted]() project and every kind of supplies and accessories to express your creativity by knitting by the fireplace in the upcoming winter nights.

I am huge fan of the Danish franchise Sostrene Grene: their youtube channel is always a great source of inspiration when it comes to crafting and DIY project such as these [Christmas ornaments in felt]().

_**Stop by the farmer’s market**_

I love slow living because it doesn’t just have to be about you but also about your impact on the environment and everyone else around you. One of the best ways to implement slow living in the kitchen is by buying seasonal produce. And the best place to shop seasonally? Your local farmer’s market. Pop over and walk around, meet the farmers and see what goodies you can find. I love to view it as a challenge and then come up with a dish when I get home from whatever I found. At our local market, there’s usually a few people who make full dishes as well so I love grabbing some Italian dairies such as burrata or mozzarella but made with local Irish milk that I will transofrm into a Caprese salad by adding some chopped tomatoes, oregano and olive oil. Sometimes I simply cannot resisit and I go straight to my favourite bakery stand to get an almond croissant for my husband and a slice of chocolate brownie for me. I found it aldo a great way to connect with the neighborhood and meet more like-minded people that truly care about where their food comes from. And don’t forget your reusable shopping bags!

_**Catch a sunrise or sunset**_

With the colder months approaching also comes shorter days. As much as I love the endless sunshine in the summer here in Ireland, I really love my sunsets and sunrises. Take a few minutes to sit on your porch, walk to the park, or wherever you can catch the view and just enjoy it. Get your Vitamin D and maybe bring along a thermos full of a hot drink. It’s the little things that make our lives magical.

_**Read by candlelight**_

One of the best ways to unwind is by running a warm bath with your favorite bath bombs, lighting all the candles, playing some relaxing music, maybe sipping on a glass of wine, and delving into a new book. Reading by candlelight instantly gives me cozy vibes and is something I love doing in the autumn months. Some books on my list to read over these next few months:

- The Murder at the Vicarage by Agatha Christie
- Coming Home to the Comfort Food by Debbie Johnson
- Trick or Murder?: A Sophie Sayers Village Mystery by Debbie Young
- Friends, lover, chocolate by Alexander McCall Smith

_**Visit a pumpkin patch**_

This one is quite a new activity to me. I grew up in Italy where Halloween definetely is not a thing and the weher stars to get chilled right before Christmas. Since I moved to Ireland around three years ago, I started watching at those groups of families and friends bringing their little ones to visit family-owned pumpkin patches and spend hours wandering around finding the best pumpkins they could. Can't wait to get home to carve the pumpkins while my husband roasted the pumpkin seeds for a snack. I think it is the perfect welcome to autumn, and is a tradition I hope to carry down in my family for the future.

_**Embrace more hygge**_

Hygge is all about the idea of being cozy and enjoying togetherness. Grab a book and spend the night in, make dinner for all your friends, light candles, take a bath… there are so many ways to curate more hygge into your life. If you’re looking for a place to start, have a look at the hygge manifesto par excellence, [The Little Book of Hygge: Danish Secrets to Happy Living]() by Meik Wiking.

And with that, I welcome you to autumn, friend. Let’s savor every moment.
